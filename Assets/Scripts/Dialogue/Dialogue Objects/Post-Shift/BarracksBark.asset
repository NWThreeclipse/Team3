  sentences:
  - I think this is a model of the ship I'm on. It says "Generation 20". Is that
    how long it has been traveling?
  - "I seem to remember having one of these\u2026 There are blood stains on it. I
    wonder who's blood this was."
  - This infection is the Phenotaint! I now remember! I was studying the disease.
    If I recall correctly, the Phenotaint turned the victims into suggestable automatons,
    I think I was close to finding a cure.
  - This doesn't make sense... This looks like a device for distributing chemicals
    in the water, but it contains the Phenotaint. Someone must have engineered the
    Phenotaint and infected the population!
